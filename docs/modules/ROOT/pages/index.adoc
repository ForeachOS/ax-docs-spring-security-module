= SpringSecurityModule

This module enables support for {spring-security-url}[Spring security] for an Across based application.
The standard Spring security filter chain and method security annotation processors will be registered automatically if this module is present.
It also allows other Across modules to customize the security rules of your application.

The `SpringSecurityModule` registers 2 separate modules:

* The `SpringSecurityInfrastructureModule` provides the <<security-principal,SecurityPrincipal infrastructure>> as early as possible during the bootstrap phase.
* The `SpringSecurityModule` itself is responsible for registering the security filters.

Only the `SpringSecurityModule` should be manually added to the `AcrossContext`, the infrastructure module will be added automatically.
